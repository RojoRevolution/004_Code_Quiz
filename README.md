# Timed Quiz with Javascript Built Dynamic Options

[Github Repo](https://rojorevolution.github.io/004_Code_Quiz/)

The goal of this project was to build a multiple choice, timed quiz primarily with Javascript. The project is unfortunately incomplete as I hit a major road block early on which I did not figure out until the final day before it was due. Due to this, I spend the majority of my time trying to build out the Javascript document, as I am already very familiar with HTML and CSS, but am still tryingt to learn Javascript further. 

*Given a bit more time I am confident I would have able to deliver a complete and polished product. And I do hope to return and compelte it in the near future.*

## Conditions for the project as follows

- Page begins with a Start Button
- When button is clicked, the timer starts to countdown and the first question appears
- When question is answered, question is validated, score increases, and next question is shown
- If a question is answered wrong, score and time decreases
- When all questions are answered or timer reaches zero, the game ends 
- When the game ends, allow user to enter initials and display score

## Issues and Incompletes

As I mentioned, I unfortunately was not able to finish the project in the alloted time. The following are some of the known things that were left out and or I did not get a chance to fix / tweak.

- Did not get a chance to validate/limit btn clicks to 1, so you can click the same button really quick to get more points added.

- The correct / incorrect message should have probably been rendered elsewhere so the questions could transition faster

- Did not add enough question due to time constraints and more question not being my priority.

- Was not able to validate the game when all questions are answered - as such, ending the game this way throws an error. The timer also does not reset when the game ends this way.

- I was however able to validate the game when the timer runs out. When this happens, your score is displayed and you get the option to play again
